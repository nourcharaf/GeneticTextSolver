# Simple Text Genetic Algorithm

## Project Overview

This project implements a simple **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** in C++ designed to evolve a population of random strings until it matches a target text string. It demonstrates the basic principles of genetic algorithms, including selection, crossover, and mutation, applied to text.

## Features

- Target-based string evolution
- Population initialization with random strings
- Fitness calculation based on string similarity
- Selection, crossover, and mutation operators
- Evolutionary process visualized step-by-step

## How It Works

1. **Initialize Population**: A population of random strings is generated.
2. **Fitness Calculation**: The fitness of each string is calculated based on how close it is to the target string.
3. **Selection**: Strings with higher fitness are selected for reproduction.
4. **Crossover**: Pairs of strings are combined to create new offspring.
5. **Mutation**: Random mutations are introduced to maintain diversity.
6. **Evolution**: The population evolves over several generations until the target string is matched.

You can play with "Parameters.hpp" to test and get varying outputs

Enjoy !
